# Building a Modern E-Commerce Platform

E-commerce has become an essential part of modern business, and building a robust online store requires careful planning and the right technology stack.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a full-featured e-commerce platform that includes:

- Product catalog with filtering and search
- Shopping cart functionality
- Secure checkout process with Stripe
- Order management system
- Responsive design for all devices

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with server-side rendering
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and better code quality
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling and responsive design
- **Stripe** - Payment processing integration
- **Vercel** - Hosting and deployment

## Key Features

### Product Management

The platform includes a comprehensive product management system with categories, filtering, and search functionality.

### Shopping Cart

A persistent shopping cart that maintains state across sessions using local storage.

### Secure Checkout

Integration with Stripe for secure payment processing and order confirmation.

## Challenges and Solutions

### State Management

Managing cart state across multiple components required careful planning. I used React Context API to create a global cart state.

### Payment Integration

Integrating Stripe required understanding webhooks and secure payment flows. I implemented proper error handling and confirmation screens.

## Lessons Learned

Building this e-commerce platform taught me valuable lessons about:

- Payment gateway integration
- State management in complex applications
- Security best practices for handling sensitive data
- Performance optimization for product catalogs

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of modern web technologies in building production-ready e-commerce solutions. The combination of Next.js, TypeScript, and Stripe creates a robust foundation for online retail.
