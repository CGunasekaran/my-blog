# Building My Portfolio Website

Creating a personal portfolio is one of the most important steps for any developer. It's your digital identity, your showcase, and often your first impression to potential employers or clients.

## Why I Chose Next.js

Next.js has become my go-to framework for several reasons:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Better SEO and faster initial page loads
2. **File-based Routing** - Intuitive and easy to organize
3. **API Routes** - Build full-stack applications without a separate backend
4. **Image Optimization** - Automatic image optimization out of the box
5. **TypeScript Support** - First-class TypeScript support

## Tech Stack

Here's what powers my portfolio:

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform

## Key Features

### Responsive Design

The portfolio is fully responsive, working seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. I used Tailwind's responsive utilities to handle different breakpoints.

```typescript
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
